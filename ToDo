1. Plot SPEXone AOD and AE side by side
2. Make AOD and ( AE with SPEXone) around obilic take a certain radius and compute average by surface
    -> plot the curve as a function of time
    -> look also for specific modes
3. Plot ERA5 data and oci aod next to each other is there any relationships?
4. Use earthcare data to look into vertical profile after a specific region is picked
