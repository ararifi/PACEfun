1. Plot SPEXone AOD and AE side by side
2. Make AOD and ( AE with SPEXone) around obilic take a certain radius and compute average by surface
    -> plot the curve as a function of time, and as a function of radius, do we see any changes when we increase the radius
    in theory it should change since the affect from the plant should change
    -> look also for specific modes
    -> check for all coal plants on the balkan
    -> add windspeed from previous time like a term for diffusion, use era5 data
    It seems that aod values in the surroundings are greater than at the emitting side. However AE seems to show a better signal of emissions.
TAKE quality flag into account!
3. Plot ERA5 data and oci aod next to each other is there any relationships?
4. Use earthcare data to look into vertical profile after a specific region is picked
